# Example Challenge Solution

I used `cargo new --bin` to make the project, and left it at that. To run my
code, you'll need to have Rust installed (either through your package manager,
or through [Rustup]). Then just enter this directory and do `cargo run` to
compile and run my code!

```
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
```
